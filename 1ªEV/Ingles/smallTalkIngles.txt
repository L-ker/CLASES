im currently studying a Higher Technician grade in web developing i've always been keen on computing since i was little, it all started with videogames but as i grew up 
i began to feel intrigated by whats behind all those games, webs and everything and that's what took me here. 
I don't know how this year will be as we've only been here for a week for i really enjoyed first year with programming so i guess it will remain like that
although im not sure because we got really practical subjets such as web development client enviroment and others that so far seem like they have a really strong theory base
that i don't like too much
